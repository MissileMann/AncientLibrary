# Ancient Library
This adds a new block that you can find in Ancient City chests. It has a 12% chance to appear.
The object acts like a bookshelf for enchanting, but will fully power an Enchanting Table on its own without the need for extra bookshelfs.

The bookshelf can be mined fast with a pickaxe, but will still drop if mined without a tool.

Extras can be smelted into an Echo Shard.

Has a config file to change the enchanting power of the block.

Works out of the box with [Apotheosis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis), [Easy Magic](https://modrinth.com/mod/easy-magic), and [Enchanting Infuser](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchanting-infuser). Will probably work with most enchanting mods.
